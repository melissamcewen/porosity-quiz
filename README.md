# Hair Porosity Quiz

A Reddit-based interactive quiz application that helps users understand their hair porosity type. This app guides users through a series of questions about their hair characteristics and provides personalized results and care recommendations.

This is a port of the CurlsBot hair porosity quiz, by the same developer who made CurlsBot.

## App Overview

The Hair Porosity Quiz is designed to help users:

- Determine their hair's porosity level (high, low, normal, or mixed)
- Understand how their hair interacts with moisture and products
- Get personalized hair care recommendations
- Share their results with the community

The quiz uses a scoring system based on common hair characteristics and behaviors to accurately assess porosity levels. Results include both an explanation of the porosity type and specific care tips tailored to the user's hair needs.
